# LittlevGL ported boards and microcontrollers

This repository contains projects where [LittlevGL](https://littlevgl.com) is configures for a development board or microcontroller. 

Contributing is very welcome! Please, share with others if you used LittlevGL with a new board or MCU.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository somewhere: `git clone https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_boards.git`
2. Step into the repository: `cd lv_boards`
3. Step into the folder of the desired project: `cd folder_of_a_project` 
3. Initalize the submodules: `git submodule update --init .`
4. Open the project or copy/paste it where you want (e.g. IDE workspace)

## Projects

### arduino_library
LittlevGL as an Arduino library. 
Copy *arduino_library/littelvgl* to your library folder
Check the *lvgl_test* sketch to see the proting and usage

### esp32_ili9431
Driving an 320x240 TFT with ILI9432 controller via SPI using ESP32. The project is craeted in Eclipse using [ESP IDF](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). (Getting started guide [here](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/eclipse-setup.html)) To link LittlevGL and lv_examples with ESP-IDF you need to add component.mk files to each directory. Rename `lvgl_component.mk` and `lv_example_component.mk` to `component.mk` and copy to the lvgl and lv_examples directories.  

### linux_frame_buffer
Directly use Linux fame buffer (e.g. /dev/fb0) as frame buffer. Demonstrates the usage winth embedded Linux systems. The project is created in Eclipse CDT. Learn more here: [LittlevGL Blog Post](https://blog.littlevgl.com/2018-01-03/linux_fb)

### visual_studio_2017_sdl_x64
A pre-configured Visual Studio Project using SDL. The SDL library is copied and linked to the project, so you can compile it without any extra steps. The 64 bit libraries are used so it will work out-of-the-box on 64-bit systems.

### stm32f429_discovery_no_os
Cheap development board with 240x320 TFT, Resistive touch pad, 180 MHz MCU with 256kB RAM + 64 MBit SDRAM and GPU.
The CubeMX drivers are used to initilaize the peripheries. In *hal_stm_lvgl/tft/tft.h* you can enable/disable external frame buffer placement and GPU usage. The project is created with SW4STM32 IDE (Ac6 System Workbranch). Learn more here:  [LittlevGL Blog Post](https://blog.littlevgl.com/2017-07-15/stm32f429_disco_port).

### stm32f469_discovery_no_os
STM development board with 800x480 TFT and MIPI DSI interface, capacitive touch screen, 180 MHz MCU with 324kB RAM + 128 MBit SDRAM and GPU.
The CubeMX drivers are used to initilaize the peripheries. In *hal_stm_lvgl/tft/tft.h* you can enable/disable external frame buffer placement and GPU usage.
The project is created with SW4STM32 IDE (Ac6 System Workbranch).

### stm32f746_discovery_no_os
STM development board with 480x272 TFT, Capacitive touch pad, 216 MHz MCU with 320kB RAM + 64 MBit SDRAM and GPU. The CubeMX drivers are used to initilaize the peripheries. Solution uses frame buffer placed in the external SDRAM memory. GPU is configurable over USE_LV_GPU define. 16-bit color (RGB565) is used. To compile example go to Release directory and run `make`.

### stm32f769_discovery_no_os
A very powerful STM development board with 800x480 TFT and MIPI DSI interface, capacitive touch screen, 216 MHz MCU with 512kB RAM + 128 MBit SDRAM and GPU. The framebuffer is places into the SDRAM levaing a lot of RAM of the application.
The project is created with SW4STM32 IDE (Ac6 System Workbranch).

### pic32mx_r61581_no_os
A custom PIC32MX695H based board drives a 480x320 display with R61581 display controller via software parallel port.
The MCU has 512kB flash, 128 kB RAM and tuns at 80 MHz. It able to applay font anti-aliasing and even screen sized animations. 
Touch pad driver is not added yet.

### pic32mx_ssd1963_no_os
A custom PIC32MX695H based board drives a 800x480 display with SSD1963 display controller via software parallel port.
Still work in progrss.
